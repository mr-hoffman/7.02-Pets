# 7.02-Pets

In this lab we will create a Pet class that will keep track of the type of animal, color, food, noise, and name of a given animal.

## Lab

1. Create a class called Pet that has the following attributes:
   a. animal (type, i.e. dog, cat, fish)
   b. color (i.e. spooted, black, tabby)
   c. food (i.e. kibble, tuna, fish flakes)
   d. noise (meow, wood, bark, none)
   e. name
2. Make sure to use the `__init__ ` method to instantiate these attributes.
3. Create several pet objects and store them in a list.
4. Create a function that takes in a list of pets and prints out the name and food (or other) attributes.
5. Test your function.
